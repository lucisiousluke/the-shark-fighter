# Transforming Challenges into UX Opportunities at MDC Holdings

## Project Challenge
Navigating the housing market after the 2008 crash was a defining challenge at MDC Holdings. With the company experiencing significant layoffs, many senior professionals were replaced by younger, less experienced team members. This created an environment where mentorship was limited, forcing me to innovate, learn quickly, and adapt through trial and error. These circumstances helped me develop the resourcefulness and resilience required to deliver impactful results in a dynamic and high-pressure environment.

## My Role
Starting as an entry-level graphic designer, I quickly evolved into a web designer, web developer, and eventually a project manager. My responsibilities grew from creating static marketing materials, like brochures and billboards, to leading the development of interactive digital solutions. As I progressed, I played a central role in brainstorming, designing, and executing quarterly marketing campaigns, while ensuring they aligned with user needs and business goals.

## UX Solutions and Key Projects

### Web Banners & Ads
- **Challenge:** Creating interactive ads that adhered to strict size and compatibility requirements before the dominance of platforms like Google AdSense.
- **Solution:** I designed Flash-based sidebar ads tailored to specific housing developments and events. Each banner was optimized for different dimensions while maintaining visual consistency and brand identity.

#### UX Impact:
- Delivered precise, visually engaging ads that aligned with strict partner site guidelines.
- Ensured user-friendly interaction and clear calls to action.

### Website Rebuild for Richmond American Homes
- **Challenge:** Modernize an outdated CMS and update the company’s digital presence to reflect a new branding strategy.
- **Solution:** Collaborating with a team of four designers, I helped rebuild the website with updated styling and improved coding standards. The redesign introduced a consistent color palette and positioned the brand to appeal to a broader demographic.

#### UX Impact:
- Enhanced navigation and accessibility, improving user engagement across the site.
- Established a cohesive visual identity that resonated with target audiences.

### Landing Pages & Microsites
- **Challenge:** Create engaging, interactive microsites for quarterly events within tight deadlines.
- **Solution:** I used Flash technology (AS2/AS3) to develop microsites featuring dynamic content and interactive elements. These projects provided users with engaging experiences while maintaining a clear focus on the event’s objectives.

#### UX Impact:
- Delivered memorable user experiences that increased event participation.
- Applied foundational programming skills to enhance usability and interaction.

### Optimizing for the Mobile Market
- **Challenge:** The company’s digital presence was not optimized for mobile, with a non-responsive website and email campaigns designed solely for large screens.
- **Solution:** I led the adoption of responsive design principles, ensuring seamless functionality across devices using minimal additional code. I also implemented early tracking methods to monitor mobile engagement.

#### UX Impact:
- Enabled accessibility for users on emerging mobile platforms.
- Enhanced the site’s usability and reach by optimizing it for a variety of screen sizes.

## Key Takeaways
My time at MDC Holdings taught me the importance of prioritizing user-focused design in every aspect of digital strategy. From optimizing for mobile responsiveness to creating visually engaging interactive content, each project honed my ability to deliver innovative solutions that balance creativity and functionality. These experiences laid the groundwork for my ability to manage complex challenges, drive collaboration, and create impactful, user-centered outcomes.
