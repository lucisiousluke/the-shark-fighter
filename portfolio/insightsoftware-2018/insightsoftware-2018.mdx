InsightSoftware: Rebranding and UX Strategy for Hubble ERP Product
About InsightSoftware
InsightSoftware is a global provider of financial reporting and enterprise resource planning (ERP) solutions, with a focus on delivering innovative products that help businesses streamline operations and improve financial decision-making. As the parent company of the Hubble ERP product, InsightSoftware sought to establish a unique identity that highlighted its suite of products, leadership, and corporate achievements.

Project Challenge
InsightSoftware’s goal was to create a modern, independent brand identity that would resonate with both current customers and potential clients. The key challenge was to redesign the company website to:
Create a Holistic ERP Experience: Communicate InsightSoftware's complete suite of ERP products, including Hubble, in a cohesive and user-friendly way.
Highlight Leadership and Success: Showcase the corporate leadership, key products, and successes of InsightSoftware to build trust with potential clients and reinforce the company’s credibility.
Simplify the User Journey: Design a clean, intuitive experience that made it easier for users to learn about the products, explore case studies, and get in touch with the sales team.

My Role
As part of the redesign project, my role evolved from a graphic designer and web developer to a design lead and digital marketing manager. I worked on the project to improve both the visual appeal and user experience of the InsightSoftware website. My responsibilities included:
UX Strategy Development: I worked to create a user-centric design that presented a holistic view of the ERP offerings, providing visitors with a seamless and informative experience.
Managing Design Execution: I collaborated with designers and developers to establish a clean, modern design that reflected the new identity of InsightSoftware and was aligned with the company’s goals.
Showcasing Leadership and Corporate Success: Working closely with the leadership team, I ensured that their contributions and the company’s successes were prominently displayed to help build credibility and engage potential clients.
Improved User Flow: I focused on simplifying navigation to guide users smoothly through the various ERP product offerings, case studies, and leadership insights, ensuring that the path to purchase or contact was clear and easy.

Objective
The primary objective of the InsightSoftware rebranding was to:
Establish a Distinct Identity for InsightSoftware: Create a unique online presence that reflected the company’s evolution and separated it from the broader ERP landscape, with a focus on the Hubble ERP product and its suite of features.
Showcase Products and Leadership: Highlight InsightSoftware’s full product suite, leadership achievements, and corporate success stories in a way that resonated with prospective clients.
Improve Usability and Conversion: Streamline the website’s structure and layout to provide visitors with a clear, intuitive experience, from product exploration to reaching out for more information or making a purchase.

Market Research
During the rebranding process, we conducted research into how other ERP companies, including larger players like Oracle and smaller, emerging firms, were presenting their products and leadership teams. Our key findings were:
Limited Innovation in ERP Marketing: Most ERP websites were outdated, complex, and not designed with user experience in mind. Many focused on product features rather than showcasing the real-world value and leadership behind the company.
Need for Transparency and Trust: ERP buyers were more likely to convert if they could see that the company had a trusted, forward-thinking leadership team and a history of corporate success.
Simplification of User Journey: ERP websites often had complicated navigation, overwhelming product information, and lengthy decision-making processes. We identified an opportunity to streamline this journey by reducing unnecessary steps and highlighting the most critical information.

Wireframe
The wireframing process for the InsightSoftware website centered on organizing content in a way that clearly communicated the breadth of the ERP product offerings while also showcasing leadership and success. The key structural improvements included:
Product-Centric Layout: We grouped content into clear sections: "Products," "Leadership," "Customer Success," and "Company Overview," making it easier for visitors to explore each aspect of the business.
Leadership and Case Studies: Sections dedicated to the leadership team and customer success stories were incorporated to build trust and credibility.
Intuitive Navigation: We streamlined the menu and improved the information architecture to allow users to quickly find product details, case studies, and company insights without unnecessary clicks.

Prototype
Once wireframes were approved, we focused on refining the design for both aesthetics and user flow:
Modern, Simple Design: The new design embraced a clean, minimalist style with ample white space, a modern color palette, and easy-to-read typography that appealed to a professional audience.
Leadership Focus: A dedicated leadership section featured professional portraits and brief bios of key company figures, positioned alongside their achievements and contributions to InsightSoftware’s success.
Product Integration: Products like Hubble were integrated into the site in a way that showcased their features while also educating potential customers on the holistic benefits of using InsightSoftware’s ERP solutions.
Each page template was designed with UX in mind, ensuring a consistent user experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. Multiple rounds of feedback and testing were incorporated to refine the user journey.

UX Improvements
The following UX improvements were made to ensure the new InsightSoftware site delivered a seamless, intuitive experience for users:
Simplified Navigation: We redesigned the navigation to eliminate clutter, making it easier for users to find relevant information quickly, whether they were exploring the product or learning more about the company’s leadership.
Leadership and Trust Elements: Highlighting leadership’s success and the company’s achievements helped build trust and positioned InsightSoftware as an innovative, credible player in the ERP market.
Clean Layout for Products and Case Studies: Product pages were streamlined to present relevant information with minimal distractions, making it easier for users to make decisions. Case studies were prominently featured to demonstrate the real-world application of the software.
Consistent Branding: A modernized, cohesive design system was implemented to give the site a fresh, professional look, reflecting the evolving brand identity while maintaining a strong connection to the company’s legacy.

Results and Impact
The redesigned website achieved the following key results:
Improved User Experience: The streamlined design and simplified navigation resulted in higher engagement and improved conversion rates, with users spending more time exploring product offerings and leadership insights.
Increased Brand Credibility: Showcasing leadership and corporate success stories built trust with potential customers, helping establish InsightSoftware as a reputable, forward-thinking brand in the ERP space.
Holistic Product Display: The website now effectively presents InsightSoftware’s complete suite of ERP products, making it easier for potential clients to see the full scope of what the company offers and how the products work together.
Boost in Engagement: The site’s intuitive structure and focus on educating visitors about new trends and best practices in financial reporting attracted a broader audience, leading to higher engagement and an increase in conversions.

Conclusion
The InsightSoftware website redesign successfully created a modern, user-friendly experience that highlighted the company’s ERP products, leadership, and achievements. By simplifying the user journey, focusing on leadership and corporate success, and showcasing the company’s complete product suite, we were able to build a stronger, more credible brand presence for InsightSoftware. The project reinforced my expertise in UX strategy, team collaboration, and ensuring that design and content align with business goals.
