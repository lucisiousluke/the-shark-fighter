## Project Challenge
The goal was to create a centralized platform—"One Web"—that seamlessly integrated all brands while preserving their trust and identity. This required addressing critical UX questions, such as:
- How to ensure a consistent experience across diverse brands.
- How to create a cart system that catered to both individual users and large organizations.
- How to preserve the familiarity and trust of Bio-Techne’s existing customers while attracting new ones.

## Objective
The primary objective of "One Web" was to provide a unified platform for Bio-Techne’s diverse product offerings. Previously, customers had to navigate multiple brand-specific websites to complete an experiment. The challenge was to integrate these offerings into one cohesive platform while maintaining the distinct identity and trust of each brand.

## UX Research and Market Analysis
Our UX research began by analyzing Bio-Techne’s existing brands and their competitors. However, the unique challenges of Bio-Techne’s portfolio made direct competitor comparisons difficult. Instead, we drew inspiration from e-commerce giants like Amazon and Best Buy, focusing on strategies for presenting products from multiple brands under one platform.
### Key findings from research included:
- User pain points: Customers were frustrated by fragmented shopping experiences across multiple sites.
- Cart behavior: Scientists often needed a system that allowed them to build a cart and share it with procurement teams.
- Navigation needs: Users prioritized intuitive ways to find products that worked together seamlessly.

## Wireframing: Building the Foundation
Wireframing for "One Web" focused on developing intuitive flows and addressing user pain points. Key features included:
- Shared Cart System: A cart designed for both personal use and institutional workflows, allowing scientists to build and share product lists with procurement teams.
- Experiment Builders: Tools to help users combine compatible products for specific experiments.
- Detailed Filters: Advanced search and filtering options to help users quickly locate products across the 500,000+ catalog.
<p>Each wireframe underwent rigorous reviews with stakeholders to ensure alignment with user and business needs.</p>

## Prototyping: Visualizing the Experience
Prototyping provided stakeholders and users with a clear vision of the final site. High-fidelity prototypes incorporated:
- Design Consistency: The primary blue from legacy brands was retained, complemented by monochromatic hues in subheaders and footers for a modern, unified look. Strict rules for color usage ensured consistency across templates.
- Complex Data Presentation: Templates showcased the most intricate data to ensure scalability and functionality.
- User Testing: Prototypes were subjected to multiple rounds of user testing, refining usability and ensuring alignment with user expectations.

## Development: Frameworks and Flexibility
After evaluating various frameworks, we chose Bootstrap 4 for its flexibility, lightweight performance, and extensive documentation. This decision ensured future developers and contractors could seamlessly contribute to the project.
### Key technologies included:
- Drupal CMS (upgraded from Drupal 7 to 9): Selected for its robust security features and scalability.
- Third-party integrations: Tools like Bloomreach and Akamai enhanced e-commerce and search functionality.

## Deployment and Iterative Testing
The initial deployment of the site included a stripped-down version with a homepage, product overview pages, datasheets, and a cart system. This phased approach allowed for focused UX testing and gradual integration of additional site elements. User feedback from these tests was instrumental in refining features and improving usability.
