  <h1 className="text-cyan-500 text-4xl font-semibold mb-4">Bio-Techne: A UX-Centered Redesign</h1>

  <h2 className="text-slate-500 text-xl font-medium mb-2">About Bio-Techne</h2>
  <p className="text-slate-500 mb-6">
    Bio-Techne specializes in the development and sales of tools and services for scientific research and clinical diagnostics. The company aims to empower life sciences by offering high-quality reagents, instruments, custom manufacturing, and testing services.

  </p>

  <h2 className="text-slate-500 text-xl font-medium mb-2">Project Challenge</h2>
  <p className="text-slate-500 mb-6">
    With over 30 acquired companies operating under its umbrella, Bio-Techne faced the challenge of unifying its digital presence. The goal was to create a centralized platform—"One Web"—that seamlessly integrated all brands while preserving their trust and identity. This required addressing critical UX questions, such as:
  </p>
  <ul className="list-disc pl-5 text-slate-500 mb-6">
    <li>How to ensure a consistent experience across diverse brands.</li>
    <li>How to create a cart system that catered to both individual users and large organizations.</li>
    <li>How to preserve the familiarity and trust of Bio-Techne’s existing customers while attracting new ones.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 className="text-slate-500 text-xl font-medium mb-2">My Role</h2>
  <p className="text-slate-500 mb-6">
    As part of a cross-functional team, my responsibilities included:
  </p>
  <ul className="list-disc pl-5 text-slate-500 mb-6">
    <li>Conducting UX research to understand user behavior and identify pain points across Bio-Techne’s brands.</li>
    <li>Collaborating with stakeholders to conceptualize, test, and implement new design strategies.</li>
    <li>Designing and prototyping a unified website experience.</li>
    <li>Overseeing UX testing and refining wireframes and prototypes.</li>
    <li>Contributing to front-end development and ensuring consistency across global markets.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 className="text-slate-500 text-xl font-medium mb-2">Objective</h2>
  <p className="text-slate-500 mb-6">
    The primary objective of "One Web" was to provide a unified platform for Bio-Techne’s diverse product offerings. Previously, customers had to navigate multiple brand-specific websites to complete an experiment. The challenge was to integrate these offerings into one cohesive platform while maintaining the distinct identity and trust of each brand.
  </p>

  <h2 className="text-slate-500 text-xl font-medium mb-2">UX Research and Market Analysis</h2>
  <p className="text-slate-500 mb-6">
    Our UX research began by analyzing Bio-Techne’s existing brands and their competitors. However, the unique challenges of Bio-Techne’s portfolio made direct competitor comparisons difficult. Instead, we drew inspiration from e-commerce giants like Amazon and Best Buy, focusing on strategies for presenting products from multiple brands under one platform.
  </p>
  <ul className="list-disc pl-5 text-slate-500 mb-6">
    <li>User pain points: Customers were frustrated by fragmented shopping experiences across multiple sites.</li>
    <li>Cart behavior: Scientists often needed a system that allowed them to build a cart and share it with procurement teams.</li>
    <li>Navigation needs: Users prioritized intuitive ways to find products that worked together seamlessly.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 className="text-slate-500 text-xl font-medium mb-2">Wireframing: Building the Foundation</h2>
  <p className="text-slate-500 mb-6">
    Wireframing for "One Web" focused on developing intuitive flows and addressing user pain points. Key features included:
  </p>
  <ul className="list-disc pl-5 text-slate-500 mb-6">
    <li>Shared Cart System: A cart designed for both personal use and institutional workflows, allowing scientists to build and share product lists with procurement teams.</li>
    <li>Experiment Builders: Tools to help users combine compatible products for specific experiments.</li>
    <li>Detailed Filters: Advanced search and filtering options to help users quickly locate products across the 500,000+ catalog.</li>
  </ul>
  <p className="text-slate-500 mb-6">
    Each wireframe underwent rigorous reviews with stakeholders to ensure alignment with user and business needs.
  </p>

  <h2 className="text-slate-500 text-xl font-medium mb-2">Prototyping: Visualizing the Experience</h2>
  <p className="text-slate-500 mb-6">
    Prototyping provided stakeholders and users with a clear vision of the final site. High-fidelity prototypes incorporated:
  </p>
  <ul className="list-disc pl-5 text-slate-500 mb-6">
    <li>Design Consistency: The primary blue from legacy brands was retained, complemented by monochromatic hues in subheaders and footers for a modern, unified look. Strict rules for color usage ensured consistency across templates.</li>
    <li>Complex Data Presentation: Templates showcased the most intricate data to ensure scalability and functionality.</li>
    <li>User Testing: Prototypes were subjected to multiple rounds of user testing, refining usability and ensuring alignment with user expectations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 className="text-slate-500 text-xl font-medium mb-2">Development: Frameworks and Flexibility</h2>
  <p className="text-slate-500 mb-6">
    After evaluating various frameworks, we chose Bootstrap 4 for its flexibility, lightweight performance, and extensive documentation. This decision ensured future developers and contractors could seamlessly contribute to the project.
  </p>
  <ul className="list-disc pl-5 text-slate-500 mb-6">
    <li>Drupal CMS (upgraded from Drupal 7 to 9): Selected for its robust security features and scalability.</li>
    <li>Third-party integrations: Tools like Bloomreach and Akamai enhanced e-commerce and search functionality.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 className="text-slate-500 text-xl font-medium mb-2">Deployment and Iterative Testing</h2>
  <p className="text-slate-500 mb-6">
    The initial deployment of the site included a stripped-down version with a homepage, product overview pages, datasheets, and a cart system. This phased approach allowed for focused UX testing and gradual integration of additional site elements. User feedback from these tests was instrumental in refining features and improving usability.
  </p>

  <h2 className="text-slate-500 text-xl font-medium mb-2">Results and Impact</h2>
  <p className="text-slate-500 mb-6">
    Although still in its early stages, the "One Web" project has already yielded significant results:
  </p>
  <ul className="list-disc pl-5 text-slate-500 mb-6">
    <li>Increased Conversions: The centralized platform led to a noticeable increase in cart sizes and conversion rates.</li>
    <li>Double-Digit Growth: Despite launching mid-pandemic, Bio-Techne reported double-digit growth across all product lines.</li>
    <li>Positive Feedback: Customers and executives alike praised the streamlined user experience and modernized design.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 className="text-slate-500 text-xl font-medium mb-2">Conclusion</h2>
  <p className="text-slate-500 mb-6">
    The "One Web" project exemplifies how user-centered design and thorough UX research can transform complex business challenges into seamless, scalable digital solutions. By prioritizing user needs and leveraging industry best practices, we created a platform that not only met Bio-Techne’s business objectives but also enhanced the overall customer experience.
