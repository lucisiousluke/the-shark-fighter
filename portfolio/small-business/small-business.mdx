## Project Highlights  

### **Helping Wander Flowers Grow**  
**Challenge:** Transform a local real estate business into a user-friendly online presence for first-time home buyers in Denver.  

**Solution:**  
I designed a simple, modern rustic website that was easy to navigate for both users and the business owner. To help the business grow, I integrated SEO-focused content such as a blog about new ownership in Denver and accessible contact information. The website, built on WordPress, also featured location maps for homes and a user-friendly back end with reusable templates. This allowed the business to scale its online presence while maintaining a personal touch.  

**UX Impact:**  
- **Increased User Engagement:** The blog and location maps helped attract and retain first-time home buyers.  
- **Ease of Use:** Simple back-end management allowed the owner to update content with minimal technical knowledge.  
- **Personalized Experience:** Key information was easy to find, enhancing trust with potential customers.

### **Unscrambling the Web for Prox.io**  
**Challenge:** Revamp a complex, underperforming website for an influencer eCommerce platform.  

**Solution:**  
After inheriting an incomplete project, I rebuilt the site’s front and back end to improve speed, security, and ease of use. I focused on creating a seamless user experience while keeping the design in line with the established brand. This allowed the internal team at Prox.io to manage the site moving forward without external help.  

**UX Impact:**  
- **Improved Performance:** The site was rebuilt to be faster and more secure, providing a better user experience.  
- **Streamlined Management:** A user-friendly back end made content updates easy for the internal team.  
- **Brand Consistency:** The design followed established brand guidelines, ensuring a cohesive user experience.

### **Igniting Rusty Flames’ Growth**  
**Challenge:** Expand a local candle company’s market nationally by improving the e-commerce experience.  

**Solution:**  
The website was initially built using Shopify within WordPress, but it lacked the necessary customization for growth. I transitioned the site to WooCommerce to enable better tracking, shipping, and cross-selling options. Over time, the site grew to include clothing and home furnishings, driving significant expansion for the brand.  

**UX Impact:**  
- **Scalable E-Commerce:** The switch to WooCommerce allowed for better inventory tracking and improved shipping options.  
- **User-Centered Navigation:** Easy access to products of varying prices and sizes increased conversion rates.  
- **Growth Facilitation:** The website was flexible enough to accommodate new product lines and expand the brand's reach.
