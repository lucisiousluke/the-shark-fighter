<h1 className="text-cyan-500 text-4xl font-semibold mb-4">Hubble: Redefining the Financial Reporting Experience</h1>

<h2 className="text-slate-500 text-xl font-medium mb-2">About Hubble by insightsoftware</h2>
  <p className="text-slate-500 mb-6">
    insightsoftware, a leader in financial reporting and ERP integration solutions, sought to consolidate its evolving brand identity under one unified product: Hubble. This all-in-one solution aimed to simplify financial reporting, accelerate processes, and provide modern tools for finance professionals navigating a rapidly evolving industry.
  </p>

<h2 className="text-slate-500 text-xl font-medium mb-2">Project Challenge</h2>
<p className="text-slate-500 mb-6">After years of repositioning the company around new features and rebranding under different names, insightsoftware recognized the need for a complete transformation. The goal was to establish a cohesive brand identity that:</p>
<ul className="list-disc pl-5 text-slate-500 mb-6">
    <li>Unified all product offerings under the Hubble flag.</li>
    <li>Introduced a modern, user-focused experience that resonated with emerging finance professionals.</li>
    <li>Created a streamlined e-commerce platform to improve the customer journey.</li>
    <li>Reinvented marketing strategies to emphasize Hubble as both a reliable and innovative solution in the financial reporting industry.</li>
  </ul>
<p className="text-slate-500 mb-6">This effort required a full brand redesign, a new website with a simplified cart flow, and a comprehensive strategy to reintroduce the company with a fresh, modern appeal.</p>

<h2 className="text-slate-500 text-xl font-medium mb-2">My Role</h2>
  <p className="text-slate-500 mb-6">
    My role in the Hubble project evolved significantly over time:
  </p>
  <ul className="list-disc pl-5 text-slate-500 mb-6">
    <li>Graphic Designer and Web Developer: Initially, I was tasked with helping to construct the new Hubble website, focusing on visual and technical elements.</li>
    <li>Head of Design and Front-End Development: As the project progressed, I took charge of establishing brand rules, crafting a cohesive visual identity, and ensuring a seamless front-end user experience.</li>
    <li>Digital Marketing Manager: In the final phase, I led the redesign of the entire website and its infrastructure, driving improvements in SEO, analytics, and digital strategy.</li>
  </ul>

 <h2 className="text-slate-500 text-xl font-medium mb-2">Objective</h2>
  <p className="text-slate-500 mb-6">
    The overarching goal was to make Hubble a modern, approachable brand that:
  </p>
  <ul className="list-disc pl-5 text-slate-500 mb-6">
    <li>Attracted recent graduates and young professionals entering the finance world.</li>
    <li>Provided an intuitive platform to showcase Hubble’s features and benefits.</li>
    <li>Educated users about emerging trends in financial reporting and ERP integration.</li>
  </ul>


 <h2 className="text-slate-500 text-xl font-medium mb-2">Market Research</h2>
  <p className="text-slate-500 mb-6">
    The financial reporting industry, dominated by legacy solutions like Oracle, lacked significant innovation. Insight revealed key opportunities:
  </p>
  <ul className="list-disc pl-5 text-slate-500 mb-6">
    <li>Outdated Competitors: Most tools in the market had an "if it isn’t broken, why fix it" mentality, leaving them clunky and reminiscent of outdated systems like Windows 95.</li>
    <li>Time Savings for Accountants: Streamlining year-end reporting processes for large organizations became a central focus, emphasizing faster ERP connections and a user-friendly interface.</li>
  </ul>
  <p className="text-slate-500 mb-6">
    By identifying these pain points, the Hubble project aimed to stand out with a modern, streamlined UX that prioritized efficiency and usability.
  </p>

  <h2 className="text-slate-500 text-xl font-medium mb-2">Wireframe Development</h2>
<p className="text-slate-500 mb-6">The wireframing process centered around creating a clear site architecture and intuitive navigation:</p>
<ul className="list-disc pl-5 text-slate-500 mb-6">
<li>URL Structuring for Growth: Careful planning of URLs was key to boosting search engine visibility and driving organic growth.</li>
<li>Brand Focus: The website was divided into two major sections:</li>
<li>Applications: Highlighting individual tools and features within the Hubble ecosystem.</li>
<li>Platform: Demonstrating how these components worked together as a cohesive solution.</li>
</ul>
<p className="text-slate-500 mb-6">
    Wireframes were meticulously crafted to balance detailed product explanations with a simple and engaging user flow, ensuring both new and returning visitors could easily access relevant information.
  </p>

<h2 className="text-slate-500 text-xl font-medium mb-2">Brand Development and User Experience</h2>
  <p className="text-slate-500 mb-6">
    Creating Hubble’s new identity involved:
  </p>

    <li>Modern Visual Identity: A clean and contemporary design system was introduced, incorporating vibrant colors, simplified typography, and consistent branding elements to appeal to younger audiences.</li>
    <li>Streamlined UX Design: Simplified navigation to allow users to quickly find product features and solutions. A redesigned cart flow to minimize friction in the purchasing process.
