Hubble: Redefining the Financial Reporting Experience
About Hubble by insightsoftware
insightsoftware, a leader in financial reporting and ERP integration solutions, sought to consolidate its evolving brand identity under one unified product: Hubble. This all-in-one solution aimed to simplify financial reporting, accelerate processes, and provide modern tools for finance professionals navigating a rapidly evolving industry.

Project Challenge
After years of repositioning the company around new features and rebranding under different names, insightsoftware recognized the need for a complete transformation. The goal was to establish a cohesive brand identity that:
Unified all product offerings under the Hubble flag.
Introduced a modern, user-focused experience that resonated with emerging finance professionals.
Created a streamlined e-commerce platform to improve the customer journey.
Reinvented marketing strategies to emphasize Hubble as both a reliable and innovative solution in the financial reporting industry.
This effort required a full brand redesign, a new website with a simplified cart flow, and a comprehensive strategy to reintroduce the company with a fresh, modern appeal.

My Role
My role in the Hubble project evolved significantly over time:
Graphic Designer and Web Developer: Initially, I was tasked with helping to construct the new Hubble website, focusing on visual and technical elements.
Head of Design and Front-End Development: As the project progressed, I took charge of establishing brand rules, crafting a cohesive visual identity, and ensuring a seamless front-end user experience.
Digital Marketing Manager: In the final phase, I led the redesign of the entire website and its infrastructure, driving improvements in SEO, analytics, and digital strategy.

Objective
The overarching goal was to make Hubble a modern, approachable brand that:
Attracted recent graduates and young professionals entering the finance world.
Provided an intuitive platform to showcase Hubble’s features and benefits.
Educated users about emerging trends in financial reporting and ERP integration.

Market Research
The financial reporting industry, dominated by legacy solutions like Oracle, lacked significant innovation. Insight revealed key opportunities:
Outdated Competitors: Most tools in the market had an "if it isn’t broken, why fix it" mentality, leaving them clunky and reminiscent of outdated systems like Windows 95.
Time Savings for Accountants: Streamlining year-end reporting processes for large organizations became a central focus, emphasizing faster ERP connections and a user-friendly interface.
By identifying these pain points, the Hubble project aimed to stand out with a modern, streamlined UX that prioritized efficiency and usability.

Wireframe Development
The wireframing process centered around creating a clear site architecture and intuitive navigation:
URL Structuring for Growth: Careful planning of URLs was key to boosting search engine visibility and driving organic growth.
Brand Focus: The website was divided into two major sections:
Applications: Highlighting individual tools and features within the Hubble ecosystem.
Platform: Demonstrating how these components worked together as a cohesive solution.
Wireframes were meticulously crafted to balance detailed product explanations with a simple and engaging user flow, ensuring both new and returning visitors could easily access relevant information.

Brand Development and User Experience
Creating Hubble’s new identity involved:
Modern Visual Identity: A clean and contemporary design system was introduced, incorporating vibrant colors, simplified typography, and consistent branding elements to appeal to younger audiences.
Streamlined UX Design:
Simplified navigation to allow users to quickly find product features and solutions.
A redesigned cart flow to minimize friction in the purchasing process.
Clear calls-to-action and resource pages to guide users through the buying journey and educate them on the platform’s capabilities.
Responsive Design: Ensuring the site delivered a seamless experience across all devices, critical for attracting digitally savvy professionals.

Results and Impact
The Hubble rebranding project successfully repositioned the company as an innovative leader in financial reporting. Key outcomes included:
Stronger Brand Identity: Hubble became synonymous with modern financial reporting solutions, appealing to both established organizations and younger finance professionals.
Improved User Experience: Streamlined site navigation, cart flows, and responsive design contributed to increased user satisfaction and conversions.
Enhanced Market Visibility: SEO-optimized content and an organized site structure drove significant organic traffic growth.

Conclusion
The Hubble project was a transformative initiative for insightsoftware, allowing the company to unify its offerings and establish a strong, modern identity. Through strategic design, research-driven decisions, and a focus on user experience, we positioned Hubble as a trusted, forward-thinking brand in the financial reporting space. This project not only redefined the company’s future but also provided an invaluable opportunity for me to grow as a designer, developer, and digital marketing leader.
