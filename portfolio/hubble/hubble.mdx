## Market Research

The financial reporting industry, dominated by legacy solutions like Oracle, lacked significant innovation. Insight revealed key opportunities:

- **Outdated Competitors:** Most tools in the market had an "if it isn’t broken, why fix it" mentality, leaving them clunky and reminiscent of outdated systems like Windows 95.
- **Time Savings for Accountants:** Streamlining year-end reporting processes for large organizations became a central focus, emphasizing faster ERP connections and a user-friendly interface.

By identifying these pain points, the Hubble project aimed to stand out with a modern, streamlined UX that prioritized efficiency and usability.

## Wireframe Development

The wireframing process centered around creating a clear site architecture and intuitive navigation:

### **URL Structuring for Growth**
Careful planning of URLs was key to boosting search engine visibility and driving organic growth.

### **Brand Focus**
The website was divided into two major sections:

- **Applications:** Highlighting individual tools and features within the Hubble ecosystem.
- **Platform:** Demonstrating how these components worked together as a cohesive solution.

Wireframes were meticulously crafted to balance detailed product explanations with a simple and engaging user flow, ensuring both new and returning visitors could easily access relevant information.
