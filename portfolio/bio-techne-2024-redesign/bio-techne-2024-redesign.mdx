## Bio-Techne: Site Redesign and UX Modernization

### About Bio-Techne

With a diverse portfolio of over 500,000 products and a presence in more than 40 countries, Bio-Techne empowers scientific research through innovation and reliability.

## Project Challenge

In 2024, Bio-Techne underwent a major redesign to modernize the look and feel of its website, aligning with the company’s growing brand identity and evolving customer needs. The challenge was to:

- **Create a Modern User Experience:** The existing website needed a complete overhaul to provide a more intuitive, engaging experience that reflected the company’s cutting-edge technology and products.
- **Unify Design Across Multiple Brands:** With numerous subsidiaries under the Bio-Techne umbrella, the redesign had to maintain consistency while also allowing each brand to shine within the overarching Bio-Techne ecosystem.
- **Develop Scalable Components:** The new site required a component library to facilitate future updates and consistency across pages and brands.
- **Collaboration and Coordination:** Successfully managing contractors and working with internal creative teams was essential to ensure alignment on the vision, design, and execution of the project.

## My Role

As the **Project Manager** for the Bio-Techne site redesign, my role was to oversee the development process, manage external contractors, and work closely with cross-functional teams to ensure the successful execution of the new design. My responsibilities included:

### **Component Library Development**
I facilitated the creation of a scalable component library, ensuring that the new design system could be reused across the site for consistency and future growth.

### **Stakeholder Communication**
Regularly updating internal stakeholders, including marketing, product teams, and executives, I ensured alignment on the design direction, progress, and any challenges that arose.
