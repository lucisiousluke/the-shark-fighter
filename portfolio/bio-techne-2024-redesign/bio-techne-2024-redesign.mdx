Project Challenge
In 2024, Bio-Techne underwent a major redesign to modernize the look and feel of its website, aligning with the company’s growing brand identity and evolving customer needs. The challenge was to:
Create a Modern User Experience: The existing website needed a complete overhaul to provide a more intuitive, engaging experience that reflected the company’s cutting-edge technology and products.
Unify Design Across Multiple Brands: With numerous subsidiaries under the Bio-Techne umbrella, the redesign had to maintain consistency while also allowing each brand to shine within the overarching Bio-Techne ecosystem.
Develop Scalable Components: The new site required a component library to facilitate future updates and consistency across pages and brands.
Collaboration and Coordination: Successfully managing contractors and working with internal creative teams was essential to ensure alignment on the vision, design, and execution of the project.

My Role
As the project manager for the Bio-Techne site redesign, my role was to oversee the development process, manage external contractors, and work closely with cross-functional teams to ensure the successful execution of the new design. My responsibilities included:
Contractor Management: I worked directly with design and development contractors to ensure they understood the goals and requirements of the project, managed timelines, and ensured high-quality output.
UX Strategy: Collaborating with the creative team, I helped develop and implement UX improvements to create a modern and intuitive site. This involved ensuring the design was user-centered and aligned with Bio-Techne’s brand identity.
Component Library Development: I facilitated the creation of a scalable component library, ensuring that the new design system could be reused across the site for consistency and future growth.
Stakeholder Communication: Regularly updating internal stakeholders, including marketing, product teams, and executives, I ensured alignment on the design direction, progress, and any challenges that arose.

Objective
The primary goal of the redesign was to create a modern, user-friendly website that:
Enhanced User Experience: Delivered a clean, intuitive interface that allowed customers to easily navigate through Bio-Techne’s vast product offerings.
Reflecting Bio-Techne’s Brand: Emphasized the company’s reputation for innovation, while maintaining consistency across multiple subsidiaries and brands under the Bio-Techne umbrella.
Optimized for Scalability: Developed a flexible site structure that would allow for future updates and additions without compromising user experience or design consistency.

Team Collaboration
This project involved extensive collaboration between internal teams and external contractors:
Design Team: Collaborating with the creative team, I helped refine the aesthetic direction, ensuring the site’s visual elements aligned with Bio-Techne’s modern and professional brand image.
Development Team: I worked closely with developers to ensure the design was properly implemented and that the component library was efficiently constructed, making future updates simple and seamless.
Product and Marketing Teams: Regular communication with these teams ensured the site reflected the product offerings accurately, and aligned with Bio-Techne’s marketing goals and strategies.
Contractors: I managed external contractors for various aspects of the project, including design, development, and content creation, ensuring their work met the project’s high standards and deadlines.

UX Improvements
Key UX improvements were made throughout the redesign to enhance site usability and overall customer satisfaction:
Simplified Navigation: We introduced a more intuitive navigation system that allowed users to easily find the products and services they were looking for, regardless of their familiarity with Bio-Techne’s offerings.
Streamlined Product Pages: The redesign focused on optimizing product pages to display crucial information in an easily digestible format, with clear calls-to-action that guided users through the purchasing process.
Modern Aesthetic: A contemporary design language was introduced, utilizing clean lines, clear typography, and updated imagery that reflected Bio-Techne’s innovative products and cutting-edge services.
Mobile Optimization: Ensuring that the site was fully responsive, we provided a seamless experience for users on all devices, making it easy to access and navigate the site from any screen size.

Component Library and Scalability
A major focus of the redesign was creating a robust and scalable component library:
Reusable Components: I ensured that the component library was built with flexibility in mind, allowing for consistent design across the site while also enabling easy future updates.
Design Consistency: By establishing a consistent design system and clear guidelines, the component library helped maintain a cohesive look and feel across all pages and brands within the Bio-Techne ecosystem.
Future-Proofing: The new system was designed to accommodate future growth and changes, making it easy for developers and designers to implement new features without starting from scratch.

Results and Impact
The Bio-Techne site redesign resulted in:
Improved User Experience: The modernized website provided a more intuitive experience for customers, making it easier to navigate through a vast product catalog and find relevant information.
Brand Consistency: The new design helped reinforce Bio-Techne’s identity as an innovative leader in the life sciences industry, while maintaining consistency across all of its brands.
Operational Efficiency: The component library streamlined future updates, ensuring that the site could grow and evolve without the need for extensive redesigns.
Increased Engagement: The updated site design led to improved user engagement, longer session times, and a higher rate of conversion as visitors found the site easier to use and more aligned with their needs.

Conclusion

Through careful project management, UX improvements, and the development of a scalable component library, we were able to create a site that not only looked great but also delivered an optimized experience for all users.
